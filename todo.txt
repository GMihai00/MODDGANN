MOTIVATION:
-no modules that could detect tonsil stones (and gastric reflux from just normal oral cavity images, to bee seen if enough photos can be found)
-telemedicine applications

DONE:
-research on the field
-critical analysis paper
-collected necesarry images to build the dataset
-labeled preliminary dataset
-set up model building environmnent

TO DO:
-data augmentation (+ look into GANNS) (ETA: 2 weeks)
-deepen AI knowledge on classification problems (ETA: 1 week)
-experiment and research on already created models for image recognition, 
try to highlight their streghts and flaws (ETA: 1.5 weeks)
-model design from scratch + train on preliminary dataset (ETA: 1-2 months)
-try to collect more images so have equal amount for each disease (ETA: ?)
-reevaluate images by expert  (ETA: ?)
-model retrain on final dataset  (ETA: 1 week)

If I have enough time:
-model hosting (Azure) (ETA: 1 week)
-Full Stack Application to provide easy access to model (probablly python flask BE + React Native FE) - (ETA: ~3 months)
