Primary Research Questions:

How can Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANNs) improve the detection of mononucleosis-related oral diseases using image-based classification?
What are the challenges associated with building a dataset for mononucleosis detection, and how can data augmentation techniques address class imbalance?
How does an ensemble-based classification approach compare to single-model classifiers in terms of accuracy and reliability for oral disease detection?
Can AI-assisted diagnostic tools reduce the rate of misdiagnosis for mononucleosis by providing automated second opinions?
What impact does the use of synthetic data generated by GANNs have on the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models in medical imaging?

Secondary Research Questions:
How does the diagnostic accuracy of the proposed AI model compare to traditional clinical diagnostic methods for mononucleosis?
What are the limitations of using publicly available image datasets for training AI models in medical diagnostics, and how can they be mitigated?
How effective is the three-stage binary classification model in differentiating between mononucleosis, tonsillitis, and pharyngitis?
What improvements in model architecture and training techniques could further enhance AI-based mononucleosis detection?
How can AI-driven oral disease detection be integrated into real-world clinical workflows to assist healthcare professionals?


maybe guide myself following  something like:

"
The following are the formulation of the
problems that will be discussed in this research:
1. What are the ML-specific requirements that should be
defined and what are the requirement statement
examples?
2. What modifications can be made to the SRS document
to more comprehensively define the requirements for
software with ML features?
